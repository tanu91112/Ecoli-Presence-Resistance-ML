# Predicting *E. coli* Presence and Antibiotic Resistance in Environmental Samples

This project uses **machine learning** to predict the presence of *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) and its **antibiotic resistance patterns** in environmental samples (e.g., water, soil).  
The goal is to help in **early detection** and **public health risk management** through data-driven insights.
